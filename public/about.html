<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Monali Patkal, seeking an entry-level IT position to leverage my
  technical skills and support innovative solutions. I hold a Bachelor of
  Engineering in Information Technology from Amrutvahini College of Engineering, 
  affiliated with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), where I graduated with
  a CGPA of 8.91 in June 2024.</p>

<p>During my academic journey, I built a strong foundation in various programming 
  languages and technologies, including C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
  and Java. My coursework covered Distributed Systems, Social Computing, and Blockchain Technology, 
  which fueled my interest in data science and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>In March 2023, I undertook a data science internship at Infort Technology Pvt. Ltd. in Pune, 
  Maharashtra. Here, I developed two significant projects: "Taxi Fare Prediction" and 
  "Prediction of H1N1 Vaccination." This experience honed my practical skills in data science, 
  allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.</p>

  <p>One of my notable projects is the "Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection Using AI and 
    Blockchain," conducted from July 2023 to July 2024. This project proposed a framework to 
    identify fraud in medical insurance using a consortium blockchain and machine learning. 
    It aimed to automatically recognize suspicious medical records, ensuring valid implementation 
    on single-disease payment and reducing the workload of medical insurance auditors.</p>

    <p>I have also completed several courses and certifications to enhance my technical expertise. 
      These include "Introduction to Programming in C" from NPTEL, "AWS Cloud Virtual Internship" 
      from Eduskills, and "Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Virtual Internship" from Eduskills. 
      Additionally, I participated in the "Employability Skill Programme" conducted by Mahindra 
      Pride Classroom and Nandi Foundation, and completed the "Tata Cybersecurity Security Analyst 
      Job Simulation" on Forage in May 2024. 
      I also took "Introduction to Cybersecurity" by Cisco Networking Academy.</p>

      <p>Beyond academics and technical pursuits, I actively engage in extracurricular activities. 
        I participated in dance competitions at the Medha Cultural Fest of AVCOE and in badminton 
        competitions under the Phoenix Club, where I won first prize. I also organized a seminar on 
        "How to Develop Skill Set as per Industry Needs" under the IEI Student Chapter. My achievements 
        include a Gold Medal in a Taekwondo District Level Competition, 
        a Green Belt in Taekwondo, and a Senior White Belt in Martial Arts.</p>

        <p>My technical skills are complemented by strong soft skills, including good communication, 
          quick learning ability, adaptability, work ethic, and interpersonal skills. I am 
          passionate about continuous learning and thrive in dynamic environments where I can 
          apply my knowledge to solve complex problems.

          In summary, my education, technical skills, practical experience, and 
          extracurricular involvement have prepared me to contribute effectively to an 
          IT role. I am eager to bring my expertise to a forward-thinking organization where 
          I can grow and make a significant impact.</p>
